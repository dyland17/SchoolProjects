/******************************************************************************
 * This class is a homework assignment;
 * A DoubleArraySeq is a collection of double numbers.
 * The sequence can have a special "current element," which is specified and 
 * accessed through four methods that are not available in the sequence class 
 * (start, getCurrent, advance and isCurrent).
 *
 * @note
 *   (1) The capacity of a sequence can change after it's created, but
 *   the maximum capacity is limited by the amount of free memory on the 
 *   machine. The constructor, addAfter, addBefore, clone, 
 *   and concatenation will result in an
 *   OutOfMemoryError when free memory is exhausted.
 *   <p>
 *   (2) A sequence's capacity cannot exceed the maximum integer 2,147,483,647
 *   (Integer.MAX_VALUE). Any attempt to create a larger capacity
 *   results in a failure due to an arithmetic overflow. 
 *
 * @note
 *   This file contains mostly blank implementations ("stubs")
 *   because this is a Programming Project for students.
