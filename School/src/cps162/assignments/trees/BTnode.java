/******************************************************************************
* A BTnode<E> provides a node for a binary tree. Each node contains a piece of 
* data (which is a reference to an E object) and references to a left and right 
* child. The references to children may be null to indicate that there is no 
* child. The reference stored in a node can also be null.
*
* @author Beth Katz 
*    - changed name to be BTnode (Binary Tree node)
*    - shortened to be the methods that belong to the class
*      and must have instance variables to do their tasks
*    - supporting methods such as traversals and prints are in Btree class
*    - added Visitor interface that requires that a visit method be provided 
*      to define what action is done when a BTnode is visited

* @version
*   April 2007
